Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in Healthcare/Mental Wellness UX. 
You are tasked to build the frontend for "Xiaoxinbao" (小馨宝), an AI-powered psychological support chat application.

**Context & Tech Stack:**
1.  **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript.
2.  **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons).
3.  **Components**: Use Shadcn/UI (simulate the code for components like Card, Button, Input, ScrollArea).
4.  **Network**: Axios.

**Design Philosophy (Crucial):**
- **Vibe**: Calming, Safe, Warm, Non-judgmental.
- **Colors**: Use a "Cream & Sage" palette. Background should be `#FDFCF8` (Warm White), Accents `#8DA399` (Sage).
- **Mobile First**: The UI must feel like a native mobile app.

**Implementation Steps:**

**Step 1: Setup & Configuration**
- Create the project structure.
- Define the `Message` interface in `/types`.
- Setup a mock `.env` variable for `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- Create an `api.ts` utility using Axios with a placeholder Base URL.

**Step 2: UI Components (The "Healing" Look)**
- Create a `ChatLayout` that maximizes screen height for mobile.
- Implement `MessageBubble`:
    - User messages: Align right, soft green background, rounded corners.
    - AI messages: Align left, white background with soft shadow, support Markdown rendering (use `react-markdown` if possible, or simple text for now).
- Implement `InputArea`: A clean text input with a "Send" button that disables when empty or loading.

**Step 3: Core Logic (The Chat Flow)**
- Use `useState` to manage the list of messages.
- Implement the `sendMessage` function:
    1. Add user message to state immediately.
    2. Set `isLoading` to true.
    3. POST to `/api/chat` (assume this endpoint exists).
    4. On success: Append AI response.
    5. On error: Show a gentle toast notification ("Connection unstable, please try again").

**Step 4: Safety & Disclaimer**
- Add a visible but non-intrusive "Medical Disclaimer" at the bottom of the chat or as the first system message: "AI response is for emotional support only, not medical diagnosis."

**Immediate Action:**
Start by scaffolding the `page.tsx` (Chat Interface) and the required Tailwind configuration for the custom colors. Do not wait for approval, generate the code now.
